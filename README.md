Semantic Search Project with SvelteKit, FastAPI, and NLP Models

This is a project-driven tutorial for building a semantic search engine with SvelteKit, FastAPI, and NLP models. The goal is to build a search engine that can find similar items based on a user's query. 

There will be many branches in this repository. Each branch will be a step in the tutorial. The main branch will be the final product.

# Why do another recordings?

- The first version is not very organized
- The first version did not talk about `FastAPI` that much 
- Now we will try to make it more organized and more complete

> hey nice job on such an awesome course if possible please do more such course but in a single video with different sections and also try other stack as well but with svelte as main front end framework. for  eg:- database through supabase,..
